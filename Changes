# This file documents the revision history for Perl extension CatalystX-ControllerPerContext.

0.008 - 10 October 2024
  - Tweaks to some of the experimental base object stuff

0.007 - 02 January 2024
  - No changes to CatalystX::ControllerPerContext.
  - Catalyst::ControllerRole::View now supports the concept of view fragments.
    This obviously only works if your view supports it.  Right now only the
    experiemental view that ships with Valiant does.
  - CatalystX::Moose an experimental extention to Moose that adds support for
    MethodAttributes out of the box as well as allows you to initialize component
    arguments from stash or context values.   No docs because if you aren't good
    enough to figure it out from the codeyou probably shouldn't be using it at this
    stage.  Ping me if you want to know more.

0.006 - 26 August 2023
  - Some example roles that are probably dangerous.  If you cut yourself
    don't say I didn't warn you.

0.005 - 20 June 2023
  - Add hook to let you pre process arguments at component creation time.
    Useful in you need to do once time setup of variables and processing of
    configuration arguments, or other application scoped properties.

0.004 - 03 June 2023
  - fix dist metadata errors

0.003 - 06 April 2023
  - Properly set the action namespace if the namespace configuration option is set
  
0.002 - 05 September 2022

    probably upgrade.  Happy US Labor Day!
